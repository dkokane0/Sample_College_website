                                             <p>The activities of civil engineers provide them with opportunities in a variety of locations from city centres to remote construction sites. Employment pportunities are available in various State and Central Government and Semi-Government departments, viz., P.W.D., irrigation, environment, railways, municipal or local bodies, corporation etc. and private sectors (like design, consultancy and construction firms). There is ample scope for self-employment. With a large outlay in government sector and a matching outlay in private sector, there will be adequate employment opportunities for civil engineers for years to come. There is a consistent and continuous demand for civil engineers.</p>

                                             <p>Department of Electronics Engineering has healthy administration, robust infrastructure and enthusiastic team of faculty and non-teaching technical and supportive Staff. Highly meritorious students get admitted to this programme, not only from Maharashtra, but from all over India.<br><br>In addition to essential electronic subjects, software based subjects are also included in the curriculum which makes this course suitable for electronics and many IT industries.<br><br>Department offers one under graduate course - B.E (Electronics Engg.) and one post graduate course - M.E (Electronics and Communication Engg.). The department outfits the increasing needs of technical wisdom in all associated areas of electronics engineering such as Microelectronics, Communication, Control and Instrumentation, power electronics, Microcontrollers, Signal and Image Processing etc. . There are around 12 well equipped laboratories which includes a PG lab exclusively meant for the research. This lab is Linux based and has many research equipment such as Mentor graphics, spectrum analyzer, digital storage oscilloscopes, high frequency counter, antenna trainer kit, Combiscopes, pneumatic trainer kit etc. These laboratories are monitored and maintained by skilled and experienced staff.&nbsp; <br><br>Department has an independent library with 1500 text books and Journals with open access for students.<br><br>Department frequently organizes guest lectures by leading industrialist and technologist’s to keep the students in tune with the latest technological developments. Innovation, Paper Presentation Contest and Project Competitions are held to bring out the latest technical and organizational skills of the students. Industrial trainings are regularly arranged to expose the students to the industrial environment.<br><br><font size="3"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Highlights</span></font><br><ul><li>Electronics Engineering Students Association (EESA) conducts various technical activities for the students.</li><li>Student members of EESA have actively participated in various technical events conducted throughout India.</li><li>The Department conducts various Technical seminars, symposia and workshops for the students and faculties.</li><li>The Faculty Members of the Department actively publish technical papers in various National Conferences and symposia every year.</li><li>The Faculty Members of the Department actively publishing Books.</li><li>Advance teaching aids for effective teaching.</li><li>Faculty of the department work as a resource person.</li><li>Focus on Training prerequisites for on-campus recruitment.</li><li>All the faculties are LIFE members of ISTE.</li><li>100% of the faculty members are having Master Degree qualification.<br></li></ul><br></p>

                                    	<h3>Introduction To The Department of IT</h3>
											   
                                             <p>The Department of IT has always been on a high growth path and has experienced and dedicated faculty members with a strong commitment to engineering education. The teaching learning process at department prepares students to meet the computer technology needs of various sectors, namely, business, government, healthcare, education, manufacturing, etc. To keep pace with the current technological trends and to sharpen their skills, faculty development workshops are carried out regularly. During this four year programme, emphasis is on technology itself more than on the information it conveys.<br><br>Information technology is a growing field that offers relatively secure positions for those with solid technical skills and at least a bachelor's degree in an IT-related field. From support to engineering, there are several specializations that deal with the various facets of information technology. <br><br>The field of information technology (IT) covers the design, administration and support of computer and telecommunications systems. Some of the positions in this field include database and network administrators, computer support specialists, computer scientists, s/w programmers and system analysts. The majority of career tracks in IT entail design and operational tasks related to computer hardware components, networks and software applications.<br><br>Professionals in the IT field work with businesses and organizations to set up and support viable computer networks that will keep systems efficient and reliable. IT encompasses all hardware and software used in the storing, creation and accessing of information. Examples of technologies that professionals work with are firewalls, databases, media storage devices, networks and the Internet.<br><br><font size="4"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vision</span></span><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Vertical growth of students in rural and urban areas.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Mission</span><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">To give Value Based Education that “transform person to personalities”.</span></font><br></p>

  <p style="margin-left:-30px"><strong>Technical Event:<br><br>
This event gave a platform to the engineering students from different domains to present their vision, thoughts and ideas. With such a huge, alluring and assertive response from the students across our region at our college for the  Project Exhibition, Model Making and Poster Presentation, its gives a clear idea that students are pondering and  need a platform to keep their views and plans for the change in technology. They are urging and demanding to consider their opinion for the betterment of technology. Our department firmly believes that honing (shine)students’ intelligence with such initiatives is of utmost importance and hence department is planning for a 3 fold event in the forthcoming academic year.</strong></p>
